# Helpful Tools
In addition to the Modding API, there are many useful tools to help you creating mods.<br>
Some of the popular ones include:<br>

::: details Unity Explorer
Essentialy like a unity editor built into the game, this tool allows you to
view how the game is built from the editor side. You can find out object names,
component values and all kinds of things that will help you. You can get its BepInEx version [here](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer/releases).

::: details Assembly Publiczier
This tool takes `Assembly-CSharp` and creates a publicized version of it,
which means that all of its private fields, methods and more will become public.
Cuphead hides many of the important fields and this tool allows you to use them without reflection.
You can get it by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.AssemblyPublicizer#readme).
